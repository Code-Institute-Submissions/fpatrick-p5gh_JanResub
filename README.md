## SEO

The website has implemented SEO best practices to improve its search engine visibility and drive more traffic to the site. One important step in this process was the creation of a sitemap and robots.txt file. These files provide important information to search engines about the structure and content of the website, allowing them to effectively crawl and index the site.

Another key component of the SEO strategy for gamerhood was keyword research. This involved using tools such as Google and Wordtracker to identify popular search terms related to the products and services offered on the site. Some of the keywords that were targeted include "games," "kids gift," "game character," "gift for boys," and "sonic video game."

In addition to targeting these specific keywords, the website also optimized its content to address common questions and searches from users. For example, the website includes (on the product description added by users) information on "what video games are good for 7 year old" and "what is the most kid-friendly video game." This helps to ensure that the site is providing relevant and helpful information to users and improving its chances of ranking well in search results.

Other optimizations that were made to the site include:

Creating content that is tailored to the target audience, such as "clothes for gamers" and "mario video game"
Creating content that is tailored to the target audience's actions, such as "play video game" and "video game for kids"
Creating on social network content that targets the video games that we sell, such as "pokemon video game"
Creating on social network content that targets the questions that the target audience is searching for, such as "what are the top 10 games for kids?" and "popular kids video games"
Overall, these SEO implementation strategies will help to improve the visibility and search engine ranking of the website, driving more traffic and potential customers to the site.

# Development Choices

## Database Schema

* During development, SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

    ![models](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39106404/213752462-bfc039d5-3b66-435c-9412-2be0f29e1c6d.png)

## Agile

In this project, it was employed an Agile methodology approach, which allowed quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver a working product incrementally. To facilitate this approach, it was utilized a Kanban board to track and prioritize user stories. [Click here to access the kanban board](https://github.com/users/fpatrick/projects/2)

## Wireframe
* Initial mockup before the development
    ![IMG_8343 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39106404/213876513-6f65a728-50d5-4ac5-8459-f27484c2b6d8.png)


Wireframe for the product detail page. I believe that this is the most important page of the whole website, as it is where users will get information about the game, read reviews, and write reviews. Therefore, I wanted to make sure that this page had a clear and user-friendly layout.

In terms of design, I wanted to keep a simple and minimalist approach throughout the website. I believe that this approach helps to keep the focus on the product and not distract users with unnecessary elements. I also followed the course project structure while incorporating my own design style to give the website a unique and personal touch. Overall, my goal was to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing product detail page that would effectively showcase the game and its features to potential buyers.

# Deployment

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install dj_databse_url`
    - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary` 
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- In settings.py file import dj_database_url, comment out the default configurations within database settings and add the following: 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
    }
```

- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi:application`
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

- Push these changes to Github.

### Update Heroku Config Vars

    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):

STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
